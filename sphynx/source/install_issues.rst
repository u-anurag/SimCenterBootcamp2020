   proposed solution (untested; please provide feedback if you try)
   --------

   It appears that the gdal package is the source of the problem. We recommend downloading the
   **gdal** and **fiona** packages closest to your system configuration from

   * gdal: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal
   * fiona: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona

   Install those packages using

   * **with anaconda installation**

   conda install gdal*.whl fiona*.whl

   * **python.org installation**

   sudo pip install gdal*.whl fiona*.whl
